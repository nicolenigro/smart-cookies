330 grams all-purpose flour
6 grams baking soda
2 grams baking powder
226 grams butter, softened
297 grams white sugar
50 grams egg
4.7 grams vanilla 
5 grams matcha green tea powder

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and any remaining dry ingredients. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg, vanilla, and any remaining wet ingredients. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Stir in any mix-ins. Roll dough into balls about one inch in diameter and flatten slightly to create round discs, and place onto ungreased cookie sheets.
3. Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden.
