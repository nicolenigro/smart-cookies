330 grams all-purpose flour
6 grams baking soda
2 grams baking powder
226 grams butter, softened
297 grams white sugar
50 grams egg
4.7 grams vanilla 
5 grams matcha green tea powder

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a small bowl, stir together flour, matcha green tea powder, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Roll dough into balls about one inch in diameter and flatten slightly to create round discs, and place onto ungreased cookie sheets.
3. Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Let stand on cookie sheet two minutes before removing to cool on wire racks.
