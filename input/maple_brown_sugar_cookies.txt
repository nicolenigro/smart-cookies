290 grams all-purpose flour
6 grams baking soda
3 grams salt
115 grams unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
200 grams dark brown sugar
50 grams egg
104 grams maple syrup
4.7 grams vanilla
4.7 grams maple extract
130 grams pecan

Instructions
1. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and other dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
2. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and brown sugar together on medium speed until smooth, about 1-2 minutes. Add the egg and beat on high until combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the maple syrup, vanilla extract, maple extract, and any other wet ingredients then beat on high speed until combined.
3. Pour the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, then mix on low until combined. Add the pecans, then beat on low speed until combined. Dough will be creamy and soft.
4. Cover and chill the dough for 2 hours in the refrigerator (and up to 3-4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, though, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.
5. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
6. Roll cookie dough into balls, and bake for 12-13 minutes.
