120 grams all-purpose flour
2 grams baking powder
3 grams salt
90 grams oat
127.1 grams unsalted butter at room temperature
106.5 grams dark brown sugar
99 grams sugar
50 grams egg
2.3 grams vanilla 
57 grams cranberries
57 grams pecan
127.5 grams white chocolate chips

Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and oats. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine butter and sugars. Beat until smooth. Add egg and vanilla, and mix again.
2. Add flour mixture and beat until well blended. Add cranberries, pecans and white chocolate chips, and mix gently until blended. Refrigerate bowl for 10 minutes.
3. Line two baking sheets with a nonstick liner or parchment paper. Roll dough into balls (about 2 tablespoons per ball), and place them 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets. Press each ball gently with a fork to flatten it into a fat disk. Place sheets in oven on two racks. Bake just until cookies are pale gold, about 15 minutes; they will still be soft when hot. Cool cookies on sheet for 5 minutes, then cool on a wire rack.
