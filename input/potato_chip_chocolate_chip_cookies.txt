225 grams unsalted European-style cultured butter, at room temperature
4.7 grams vanilla
1.5 grams fine sea salt
110 grams light brown sugar
30 grams confectioners’ sugar
255 grams unbleached all-purpose flour
190 grams potato chips
175 grams semisweet chocolate chips

Instructions
1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 375 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter and any other wet ingredients on medium-high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add brown sugar and confectioners’ sugar and beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes more. Scrape down sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, then add dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until a smooth dough forms. Add mix-ins, then beat until blended.
3. Cover surface of dough with parchment paper or plastic wrap. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 7-by-11-inch rectangle (about 1/2-inch thick). Remove parchment or plastic.
4. Roll the rolling pin over the top of dough to encourage chips to adhere. Use a bench scraper or knife to cut dough into 4 dozen 1 1/4-inch-square cookies. Transfer cookies with bench scraper or small offset spatula to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 1/2 inches apart.
5. Bake 1 sheet of cookies at a time until set and golden, about 15 minutes. Let cookies cool for 3 minutes on the baking sheets before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. They will crisp up as they cool.
