240 grams all-purpose flour
12 grams baking soda
3.9 grams cinnamon
1.8 grams ginger
1.5 grams cardamom
2.7 grams kosher salt
50 grams egg
113 grams unsalted butter, melted
66 grams granulated sugar
113.3 grams molasses
53.25 grams dark brown sugar
60 grams sanding sugar

Instructions
1. Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Whisk flour, baking soda, spices, salt, and any other dry ingredients in a small bowl. Whisk egg, butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and any other wet ingredients in a medium bowl. Mix in dry ingredients just to combine. Gently add in any mix-ins.
2. Place sanding sugar in a shallow bowl. Scoop out dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls (if dough is sticky, chill 20 minutes). Roll in sugar and place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2” apart.
3. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until cookies are puffed, cracked, and just set around edges (overbaked cookies won’t be chewy), 8–10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.
