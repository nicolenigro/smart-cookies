240 grams all-purpose flour
12 grams baking soda
3.9 grams ground cinnamon
1.8 grams ground ginger
1.5 grams ground cardamom
2.7 grams kosher salt
1 egg
113 grams unsalted butter, melted
66 grams granulated sugar
113.3 grams mild-flavored (light) or robust-flavored (dark) molasses
53.25 grams dark brown sugar
Coarse sanding or raw sugar (for rolling)

1. Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and salt in a small bowl. Whisk egg, butter, granulated sugar, molasses, and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Mix in dry ingredients just to combine.
2. Place sanding sugar in a shallow bowl. Scoop out dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls (if dough is sticky, chill 20 minutes). Roll in sugar and place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2” apart.
3. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until cookies are puffed, cracked, and just set around edges (overbaked cookies won’t be chewy), 8–10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.
