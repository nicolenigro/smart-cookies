375 grams all-purpose flour 
8 grams cream of tartar
4 grams baking soda
6 grams cinnamon
2 grams salt
230 grams butter, softened
267 grams sugar
50 grams egg 
14 grams yolk
9.33 grams vanilla

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
2. Whisk together the dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
3. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract, and any other wet ingredients. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 3 different parts. The dough will be thick.
4. Roll cookie dough into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons of cookie dough each. Arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets.
5. Bake cookies for 10 minutes. The cookies will be very puffy and soft. When they are still very warm, lightly press down on them with the back of a spoon or fork to help flatten them out. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
