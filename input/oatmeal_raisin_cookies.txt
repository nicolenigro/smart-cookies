227 grams unsalted butter, softened, more for pans
200 grams dark brown sugar
66 grams granulated sugar
100 grams eggs
114 grams vanilla
187 grams all-purpose flour
4.5 grams salt
6 grams baking soda
2.6 grams cinnamon
0.7 grams freshly grated nutmeg
0.7 grams cardamom 
270 grams oat
225 grams raisin

Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter two large cookie sheets, or line them with parchment paper or reusable silicone liners.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat butter in a large bowl until creamy. Add brown and granulated sugars, then beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Then, beat in vanilla extract.
3. In a separate bowl, use a wooden spoon or spatula to mix together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom. Set mixer on low speed, and beat flour mixture into the butter mixture. Stir in oats and raisins.
4. Spoon out dough by large tablespoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie.
5. Bake until cookie edges turn golden brown, about 9 to 13 minutes. Centers will still be quite soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool. Cool completely on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
