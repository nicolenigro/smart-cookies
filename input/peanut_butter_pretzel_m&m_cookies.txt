115 grams salted butter, softened to room temperature*
100 grams light or dark brown sugar
50 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
185 grams peanut butter
4.7 grams vanilla
3 grams baking soda
160 grams all-purpose flour
150 grams M&Ms
50 grams pretzel pieces

Instructions
1. In a large bowl, using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer with paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars together on medium speed. Beat in the peanut butter, egg, and vanilla (in that order). Beat in the baking soda and flour. Do not overmix. Fold in the M&Ms and pretzels. Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Drop chilled dough by tiny tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet or Silpat. Press down to slightly flatten them out. Bake for 8-9 minutes. Cookies will be soft and may appear undone. They will firm up as they cool. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack.
