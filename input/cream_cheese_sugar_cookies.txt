375 grams all-purpose flour
6 grams baking powder
3 grams salt
230 grams unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
55 grams cream cheese
200 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
9.3 grams vanilla
2.3 grams almond 

Instructions
1. Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and any other dry ingredients together until combined. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 2 minutes on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and beat on medium high speed until fluffy and light in color. Beat in the egg, vanilla, and remaining wet ingredients on high speed. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
3. On low speed, slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. Gently stir in any mix-ins. The cookie dough will be thick. Cover dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour and up to 3 days.
4. Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 3-4 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. This makes the cookie dough easier to scoop and roll.
5. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.)
6. Scoop and roll balls of dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each. Place on the baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Using the back of measuring cup or drinking glass, gently press down on each (see photo above).
7. Bake the cookies for 13-15 minutes, or until very lightly browned on the edges. Be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. The baked cookies will look extremely soft in the centers when you remove them from the oven. Allow to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely.
