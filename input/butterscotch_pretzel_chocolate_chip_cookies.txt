250 grams all-purpose flour
5.3 grams cornstarch
6 grams baking soda
3 grams salt
170 grams unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
150 grams light or dark brown sugar
50 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
9.3 grams vanilla
45 grams pretzel pieces
90 grams butterscotch morsels
90 grams chocolate

Instructions
1. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and any other dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together on medium speed until combined and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in any additional wet ingredients. 
3. On low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be thick. Beat in the mix-ins on medium speed until combined. Cover dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes and up to 4-5 days.
4. Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.
5. Roll into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each, and arrange 2-3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until edges are slightly browned. The centers should still look pretty. While the cookies are still warm, press additional morsels or chips into the top (if desired and only for looks!).
6. Cool cookies on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
