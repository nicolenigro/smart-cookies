169.5 grams butter, softened 
198 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
9.3 grams vanilla 
210 grams all purpose flour
4.5 grams baking soda
1.5 grams salt
72 grams sprinkles
99 grams granulated sugar for rolling

Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Line a couple cookie pans with parchment paper; set aside
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together butter and sugar until pale and fluffy â€“ about 7 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add egg and vanilla; beat until fluffy. Add any additional wet ingredients.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, and any other dry ingredients. Add to the wet ingredients, beating on low speed until just starting to come together. Add in the mix-ins and beat on low until combined and the sprinkles are evenly distributed.
4. Using a cookie scoop or two teaspoons, scoop your batter out into about 3 tbsp portions out onto your baking sheets leaving at least 1.5 to 2 inches between each cookie. I usually put no more than 6 onto each tray.
5. Before baking, roll each cookie dough ball in granulated sugar and place back on the baking tray.
6. Bake for 11-13 minutes or until the tops are beginning to crackle and the edges are a light golden color.
7. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least five minutes before devouring.
