Instructions
1. Add all purpose flour and baking soda to the bowl. Mix until combined and set aside.

5. Add the dry ingredients from step 1 and all other dry ingredients to the bowl and mix with a spatula until just combined.
5. Gently add in any mix-ins.
7. Let the cookies rest in the fridge for 20 minutes.

10. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the edges are light brown.
11. Rest for 10 minutes on the baking sheets and then another 10 minutes on a cooling rack before serving.
