120 grams flour
2 grams baking powder
3 grams salt
90 grams oat
127.1 grams butter, at room temperature
106.5 grams light brown sugar
99 grams sugar
50 grams egg
4.7 grams vanilla 
85.5 grams pecan
208 grams M&M's

Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt and rolled oats. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer combine butter, light brown sugar and superfine sugar. Beat until creamy. Add egg and vanilla, and beat again until smooth.
2. Add flour mixture to butter mixture, and beat until smooth. By hand, fold in chopped pecans and M&M's.
3. Roll quarter-cup measures of dough into balls and flatten them into fat disks (about 1/2 inch thick). Place on a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet, about 6 at a time, so they have room to spread.
4. Bake until cookies are risen, dry on surface and very lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. They will be too soft to lift from baking sheet. Set aside to harden for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.
