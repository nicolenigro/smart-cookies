Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Brown your butter. Heat your butter over medium heat until it turns a golden yellow color. Pour butter in a heat proof bowl to cool. As the butter cools, it will get darker in color.
3. Combine flour, baking soda, salt,, and any additional dry ingredients in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix well and set aside.
4. Next add in white sugar and brown sugar to your butter. Mix to combine. Once well combined, add in your eggs and vanilla. Whisk together. Whisk until you get a light and creamy texture (~1 minute). Add in any additional wet ingredients.
5. Once the wet ingredients are well mixed, slowly add in the dry ingredients from step 3. Combine with a spatula until a green dough forms.
6. Add in the mix-ins and mix until they are well incorporated.
7. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

9. Bake for 9-11 minutes.
