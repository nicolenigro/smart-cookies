228 grams unsalted butter, preferably cultured, softened at room temperature
150 grams granulated sugar
170 grams light brown sugar
6 grams kosher salt
510 grams peanut butter
100 grams eggs
250 grams all-purpose flour

Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick liners. In a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars until smooth and fluffy, at least 3 minutes. Add the wet ingredients, and mix. Add the flour and salt and mix just until well combined, with no white flour showing. Add the mix-ins.
2. Using a small cookie scoop (about 2 teaspoons capacity), scoop dough onto prepared pans. The tops will be rounded but craggy. The cookies will not spread much or change shape when they bake, so they can be placed quite close together, but leave room for air circulation so they can brown.
3. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, until cookies are set and golden-brown. Carefully lift or slide off baking sheets and cool on racks. Store in layers separated by parchment paper, in airtight containers.
