113 grams unsalted butter at room temperature
128 grams tahini
200 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
14 grams egg yolk
4.7 grams vanilla
150 grams all-purpose flour
3 grams baking soda
2 grams baking powder
5.3 grams kosher salt
230 grams chocolate chips

Instructions
1. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add egg, egg yolk and remaining wet ingredients and continue mixing at medium speed for another 5 minutes.
2. Sift dry ingredients into a large bowl and mix with a fork. Add flour mixture to butter mixture at low speed until just combined. Use a rubber spatula to fold in mix-ins. Dough will be soft, not stiff. Refrigerate at least 12 hours; this ensures tender cookies.
3. When ready to bake, heat oven to 325 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick baking mat. Use a large ice cream scoop or spoon to form dough into 12 to 18 balls.  
4. Place the cookies on the baking sheet at least 3 inches apart to allow them to spread. Bake 13 to 16 minutes until just golden brown around the edges but still pale in the middle to make thick, soft cookies. As cookies come out of the oven, sprinkle sparsely with salt. Let cool at least 20 minutes on a rack.
