225 grams butter, melted 
213 grams dark brown sugar
170 grams sugar
100 grams eggs 
9.33 grams vanilla 
355 grams all-purpose flour
4 grams baking soda
4 grams salt

Instructions
1. In a large bowl add in the melted butter, both sugars, eggs and vanilla extract and whisk together until combined. Whisk in any additional wet ingredients.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, salt, and any other dry ingredients.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with a spatula to form your cookie dough. Gently stir in any mix-ins.
4. Using a 1/4 cup measure, scoop the cookie dough base into roughly 14 cookies (weighing roughly 2 1/2 oz each).
5. When ready to bake preheat the oven to 375ºF (185°C).
6. Roughly shape the cookies back into balls of dough before placing the cookies on a large parchment lined cookie sheet about 4 inches apart.
6. Bake for roughly 12 minutes or until you can still see it is doughy in the center but browning around the edge. Resist the urge to bake for longer as you will over bake it and lose that gooey center.
7. Let cool on the sheet for 5 minutes then enjoy!
