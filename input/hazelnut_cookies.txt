27.2 grams vegetable oil
84.8 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
106.5 grams dark brown sugar
66 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
2.3 grams vanilla
120 grams flour
3 grams baking soda

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Place the hazelnuts in a food processor and grind coarsely. Reserve 1/4 cup of the hazelnuts. Grind the remaining nuts fine and add the oil. Blend the mixture thoroughly into a hazelnut butter. Set aside.
3. Cream the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy. Beat in the hazelnut butter, the egg and the vanilla. Mix thoroughly.
4. Sift the flour and add with the baking soda, salt, and remaining dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly and add the reserved hazelnuts. Using a teaspoon, form the dough into balls and arrange them 2 inches apart on baking sheets that have been greased or lined with parchment paper. Using the prongs of a fork that have been dipped into flour to prevent sticking, flatten the balls into 1 1/2 inch rounds
