115 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
110 grams dark brown sugar
110 grams light brown sugar
100 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
4.7 grams vanilla
190 grams dark rye flour
4 grams baking powder
2.7 grams kosher salt
170.1 grams chopped dark chocolate

Instructions
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the butter and sugars. Stir in the egg and any other wet ingredients until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined. Lastly, mix in the mix-ins.
3. Portion the cookie dough into balls slightly larger than 3 tablespoons. Roll each with your hand and place the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing the balls at least 2 inches apart. Press gently into a puck about 1-inch thick.
4. Working with one batch at a time, bake until the cookies have spread and are browned on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes. Repeat with remaining batch. Let cool for a couple of minutes on the baking sheet before transferring cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
