115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature
150 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
27 grams red food coloring, preferably gel
7 grams vanilla extract
195 grams all-purpose flour
22.2 grams cocoa powder
3 grams baking soda
2.4 gram fine sea salt
30.5 grams buttermilk
115 grams white chocolate, coarsely chopped into chunks

Instructions
1. Move racks to the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the egg and mix until fully incorporated, about 1 minute more. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
3. Add 1 tablespoon red food coloring (and up to 1 1/2 tablespoons for really red cookies) and vanilla extract and mix on medium speed to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
4. In a small bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt to combine. Add to the mixer and mix on low speed until fully incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the buttermilk (or milk) and mix on low speed to combine, then scrape down the sides of the bowl.
5. Add about 3/4 of the white chocolate and mix on low speed to combine. Scoop 2 tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2 inches between each piece. Use your palm to flatten the balls slightly.
6. Press the remaining white chocolate chunks into the surface of each piece of dough. Bake for 12 minutes, until the cookies appear set on the outside and puffed in the center, rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Cool completely on the baking sheet.
