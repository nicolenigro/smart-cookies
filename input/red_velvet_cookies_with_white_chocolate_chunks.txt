115 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
150 grams granulated sugar
50 grams egg
27 grams red food coloring
7 grams vanilla 
195 grams all-purpose flour
22.2 grams cocoa 
3 grams baking soda
2.4 gram fine sea salt
30.5 grams buttermilk
115 grams white chocolate

Instructions
1. Move racks to the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the egg and mix until fully incorporated, about 1 minute more. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
3. Add remaining wet ingredients and mix on medium speed to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
4. In a small bowl, whisk the dry ingredients to combine. Add to the mixer and mix on low speed until fully incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes, then scrape down the sides of the bowl.
5. Add mix-ins and mix on low speed to combine. Scoop 2 tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2 inches between each piece. Use your palm to flatten the balls slightly.
6. Bake for 12 minutes, until the cookies appear set on the outside and puffed in the center, rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Cool completely on the baking sheet.
