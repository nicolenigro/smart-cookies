100 grams eggs
283.5 grams chocolate
226 grams unsalted butter
235 grams all-purpose flour
5 grams baking soda
38 grams cocoa
170 grams dark brown sugar
50 grams granulated sugar
6 grams kosher salt
22 grams vanilla

Instructions
1. Cut 2 sticks unsalted butter into large pieces. Cook in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often, until it foams, then browns, 7–9 minutes. (Watch carefully since browned butter goes from brown to black in the blink of an eye.) Immediately scrape into a large bowl and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
3. While butter cools, whisk flour, baking soda, and any spices in a medium bowl to combine.
4. Add brown sugar, granulated sugar, and kosher salt to browned butter. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, stir vigorously to combine. Add 1 large egg and whisk vigorously until incorporated, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining 1 large egg and vanilla, then whisk in remaining wet ingredients.
5. Switch back to your spatula or spoon to stir in dry ingredients just to combine. Mix in the mix-ins. Let dough sit at room temperature at least 1 hour. The dough will thicken as it sits.
6. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Shape dough into ping-pong sized balls (about 3 Tbsp.). Arrange on prepared baking sheets, spacing about 3" apart.
7. Bake cookies, rotating pans top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until edges are just set but centers are still soft, 8–10 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully tap pan on stovetop to deflate and flatten cookies. Let cool on baking sheets 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
8. Transfer cookies to a platter. Serve and enjoy!
