240 grams all-purpose flour
72 grams sugar
5.3 grams kosher salt
4 grams grated lemon zest
2.8 grams black peppercorns, cracked
2.1 grams cumin seeds, cracked
226 grams unsalted butter, softened slightly and cut into pieces
4.7 grams vanilla

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put the flour, sugar, salt, lemon zest, cracked peppercorns and cumin in a food processor and pulse to combine. Add the butter and vanilla and pulse until mixture just forms a dough.
2. Place the dough on a work surface and shape into 1-inch balls. Place them 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets and flatten each cookie with the palm of your hand. Bake until lightly browned, about 15 to 20 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Remove from the tray and place them on a rack to cool.
