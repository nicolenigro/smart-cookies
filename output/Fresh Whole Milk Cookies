180.0 grams all-purpose flour 
133.5 grams oat 
9.0 grams baking soda 
8.0 grams kosher salt 
226.0 grams unsalted butter, room temperature 
198.0 grams sugar 
25.8 grams whole milk 
7.0 grams honey 

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300°. Whisk flour, oats, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in milk and honey. Turn off mixer and add dry ingredients; mix in with a rubber spatula.
2. Spoon heaping tablespoonfuls of dough onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, pressing down lightly to flatten and spacing 1½" apart. Bake cookies until golden brown, 25–30 minutes (they will crisp up more as they cool). Transfer baking sheets to a wire rack and let cool.
