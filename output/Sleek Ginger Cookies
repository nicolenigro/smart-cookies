3.0 grams salt 
127.1 grams butter, at room temperature 
106.5 grams light brown sugar 
99.0 grams sugar 
50.0 grams egg 
4.7 grams vanilla 
1.3 grams ginger 
57.0 grams cranberry 
57.0 grams pecan 
112.0 grams cream cheese 
180.0 grams white chocolate chips

Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees.
3. In a small bowl combine flour, baking powder, salt and remaining dry ingredients. Set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer combine butter, light brown sugar and superfine sugar. Beat until creamy. Add egg and vanilla, and any additional wet ingredients. Beat until mixed in.
2. Add any flour mixture to butter mixture, and beat until smooth. By hand, fold in mix-ins.
3. Roll quarter-cup measures of dough into balls and flatten them into fat disks (about 1/2 inch thick). Place on a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet, about 6 at a time, so they have room to spread.
4. Bake until cookies are risen, dry on surface and very lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. They will be too soft to lift from baking sheet. Set aside to harden for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool.
