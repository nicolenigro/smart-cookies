170.1 grams unskinned lightly toasted hazelnuts 
27.2 grams vegetable oil 
84.8 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature 
106.5 grams dark brown sugar 
66.0 grams granulated sugar 
50.0 grams egg 
2.3 grams vanilla 
120.0 grams flour 
3.0 grams baking soda 

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Place the hazelnuts in a food processor and grind coarsely. Reserve 1/4 cup of the hazelnuts. Grind the remaining nuts fine and add the oil. Blend the mixture thoroughly into a hazelnut butter. Set aside.
3. Cream the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy (this can be done in the washed food processor or with an electric mixer in a bowl). Beat in the hazelnut butter, the egg and the vanilla. Mix thoroughly.
4. Sift the flour and add with the baking soda and the salt. Mix thoroughly and add the reserved hazelnuts. Using a teaspoon, form the dough into balls and arrange them 2 inches apart on baking sheets that have been greased or lined with parchment paper. Using the prongs of a fork that have been dipped into flour to prevent sticking, flatten the balls into 1 1/2 inch rounds (Tip: If you want a clearly visible criss-cross design on the cookies, chill dough for 30 minutes before doing so).
5. Bake in the middle of the oven for 8-to-9 minutes or until the cookies are golden. Cool on racks. The cookies will keep for about a week in a sealed jar.
