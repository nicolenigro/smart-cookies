227.0 grams unsalted butter, softened, more for pans 
200.0 grams dark brown sugar 
66.0 grams granulated sugar 
100.0 grams eggs 
114.0 grams vanilla 
187.0 grams all-purpose flour 
4.5 grams salt 
6.0 grams baking soda 
0.7 grams nutmeg 
0.7 grams cardamom 
2.1 grams cumin 
427.0 grams oats 
2.6 grams cinnamon 
780.0 grams chocolate 
5.3 grams cornstarch 

Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper or reusable silicone liners.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat butter in a large bowl until creamy. Add brown and granulated sugars, then beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Then, beat in vanilla extract and remaining wet ingredients.
3. In a separate bowl, use a wooden spoon or spatula to mix together the flour, salt, baking soda, and remaining dry ingredients. Set mixer on low speed, and beat flour mixture into the butter mixture. Stir in mix-ins.
4. Spoon out dough by large tablespoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie.
5. Bake until cookie edges turn golden brown, about 9 to 13 minutes. Centers will still be quite soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool. Cool completely on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
