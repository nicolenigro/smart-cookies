280.0 grams all-purpose flour 
6.0 grams baking soda 
3.0 grams salt 
170.0 grams unsalted butter, softened to room temperature 
100.0 grams granulated sugar 
100.0 grams packed light or dark brown sugar 
50.0 grams egg 
9.3 grams vanilla 
180.0 grams white chocolate chips 
125.0 grams roughly chopped Oreos 
4.0 grams lemon zest 
2.8 grams black pepper 
2.1 grams cumin 
60.53 grams nut 

Instructions
1. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and any additional dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until completely smooth and creamy, scraping down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Add granulated sugar and brown sugar and beat on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Beat in any additional wet ingredients
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the mix-ins until combined. Cover and chill the dough for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.
4. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
5. Roll cookie dough, a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 12-13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft.
6. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
