265.0 grams all-purpose flour 
2.7 grams cornstarch 
6.0 grams baking soda 
3.0 grams salt 
170.0 grams unsalted butter, melted + slightly cooled 
150.0 grams light or dark brown sugar 
150.0 grams granulated sugar 
50.0 grams egg 
14.0 grams yolk 
7.0 grams vanilla 
210.0 grams white chocolate chips* 
120.0 grams roughly chopped macadamia nuts 

Instructions
1. Whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
2. Whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour into dry ingredients and mix everything together with a rubber spatula until completely combined. Fold in the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. (You can use a mixer for this step if needed.)
3. Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 4 days. If chilling for longer than 2 hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 20-30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.
4. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
5. Roll cookie dough into balls, about 1-1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 12-13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look soft.
6. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
