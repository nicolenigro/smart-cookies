Instructions
1. Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Whisk flour, baking soda, spices, salt, and any other dry ingredients in a small bowl. Whisk egg, butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and any other wet ingredients in a medium bowl. Mix in dry ingredients just to combine. Gently add in any mix-ins.
2. Place sanding sugar in a shallow bowl. Scoop out dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls (if dough is sticky, chill 20 minutes). Roll in sugar and place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2” apart.
3. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until cookies are puffed, cracked, and just set around edges (overbaked cookies won’t be chewy), 8–10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.
