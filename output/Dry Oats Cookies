9.0 grams baking soda

226.0 grams unsalted butter, room temperature 
198.0 grams sugar 
86.0 grams pumpkin

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300°. Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and any other dry ingredients in a medium bowl to combine. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in any other wet ingredients. Turn off mixer and add dry ingredients; mix in with a rubber spatula. Gently mix in any mix-ins.
2. Spoon heaping tablespoonfuls of dough onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, pressing down lightly to flatten and spacing 1½" apart. 
3. Bake cookies until golden brown, 25–30 minutes (they will crisp up more as they cool).
