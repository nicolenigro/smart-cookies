125.0 grams all-purpose flour 
3.0 grams baking soda 
3.0 grams salt 
115.0 grams unsalted butter, softened to room temperature 
100.0 grams dark or light brown sugar 
50.0 grams egg 
7.0 grams vanilla 
2.6 grams cinnamon 
19.8 grams maple syrup 
180.0 grams chocolate 
4.0 grams lemon zest 
2.8 grams black pepper 
2.1 grams cumin 
1.8 grams ginger 
1.5 grams cardamom 
226.6 grams molasses 

Instructions
1. Whisk the dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
2. Beat the softened butter and both sugars together on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and mix on high until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the vanilla and remaining wet ingredients and mix on high until combined.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, then mix on low speed until combined. With the mixer still running on low speed, beat in the mix-ins. Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.
4. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
5. Scoop or roll cookie dough, a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 13-14 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft. For crispier edges, bake for 15 minutes.
