128.0 grams all-purpose flour 
47.0 grams cocoa 
3.0 grams baking soda 
2.7 grams kosher salt 
113.0 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature 
101.0 grams granulated sugar 
110.0 grams packed dark brown sugar 
50.0 grams egg 
4.7 grams vanilla 
128.0 grams coconut 
170.0 grams chopped bittersweet chocolate 
119.0 grams pecan 

Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, beat butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar together with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla until smooth.
2. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture. Add coconut, chocolate and pecans and mix to just combine.
3. Portion the dough in 2 tablespoon scoops and roll them into balls. Place them on parchment-lined baking sheets, at least 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies until dry on top but still soft in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately tap the sheets against a work surface to deflate them slightly. Let the cookies sit on the sheets for 3 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.
