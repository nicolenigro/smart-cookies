Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and any additional dry ingredients. In a large bowl, beat butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar together with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla until smooth. Add in any additional wet ingredients and beat in.
2. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture. Add coconut, mix-ins and mix to just combine.
3. Portion the dough in 2 tablespoon scoops and roll them into balls. Place them on parchment-lined baking sheets, at least 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies until dry on top but still soft in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately tap the sheets against a work surface to deflate them slightly. Let the cookies sit on the sheets for 3 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.
